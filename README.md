🏠 House Price Prediction Model
This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on key property features. The model is designed to provide accurate estimates using essential factors like the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, property size, location (zip code), and the current market trends.

🔍 Features
Input Factors:
Beds: Number of bedrooms.
Baths: Number of bathrooms.
Size: Property size in square feet.
Zip Code: Location identifier for regional price trends.
Price: Target variable representing the house price.
Data Preprocessing:
Handles missing values and cleans data for better accuracy.
Encodes categorical zip codes into numerical values for analysis.
Model Training:
Utilizes algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost for prediction.
Performance Evaluation:
Metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² Score are used to assess model accuracy.

🛠️ Technologies Used
